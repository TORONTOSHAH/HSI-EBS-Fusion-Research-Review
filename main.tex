\begin{abstract}
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS) are rapidly transforming environmental monitoring and wildlife research. The integration of these technologies enhances both temporal and spectral resolution, allowing detailed, real-time ecological data collection with improved efficiency. This study investigates the fusion of HSI and EBS to monitor wildlife habitats, especially in dynamic and light-variable environments.

We propose an advanced sensor fusion framework to optimize data acquisition, processing, and transmission under field conditions. Two linear spectral compression techniques—Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)—are applied to a 96-band shortwave infrared HSI for dimensionality reduction. The compressed spectra are used to train classifiers for pixel-level classification based on spectral signatures. We analyze the effects of compression methods, the number of spectral features retained, and training sample size on classification performance. Results demonstrate that HSI can be reduced to a few synthesized spectral bands without significant loss in accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of spectral compression.

Additionally, Hyperspectrally Compressed Ultrafast Photography (HCUP) leverages compressed sensing and time- and spectrum-to-space mappings to capture transient events in a single exposure at frame rates up to tens of trillions per second. While HCUP offers ultra-fast temporal and spectral imaging, traditional reconstruction algorithms may limit image quality in complex scenes due to high compression ratios.

For monitoring aerial objects, including birds, insects, and drones, event-based vision provides high temporal resolution, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. We introduce the EV-Flying dataset, annotated with spatio-temporal bounding boxes and track identities, and employ point-based approaches inspired by PointNet for asynchronous event stream processing, enabling reliable flying object recognition.

Finally, a novel event-based active HSI system is proposed, combining dynamic illumination with an event camera to achieve high temporal resolution and spectral fidelity with low bandwidth. Using a “sweeping rainbow” illumination synchronized with a rotating mirror array, spectral variations are encoded as temporal contrasts, transforming spectral reconstruction into geometric constraints. Evaluations on synthetic and real datasets show improved temporal resolution and competitive spectral reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{W}{ildlife} monitoring has evolved significantly with advances in optical and computational sensing. Traditional approaches, such as manual surveys and standard imaging, provide valuable information but are often constrained by limited temporal resolution and environmental adaptability. Recent technologies, particularly hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS), offer a paradigm shift by capturing fine-grained spectral and temporal dynamics in complex natural habitats.

HSI captures detailed spectral information across hundreds of wavelengths, producing a three-dimensional data cube that maps radiance over two spatial axes and one spectral axis \cite{yu2025active}. This enables precise analysis of vegetation health, soil composition, and animal camouflage. However, high spectral resolution comes at the cost of large data volumes and bandwidth requirements, making real-time monitoring in remote or energy-constrained environments challenging \cite{connolly2023}.

EBS, inspired by neuromorphic vision, records only scene changes asynchronously, achieving high temporal resolution and low power consumption \cite{arxiv2024}. By detecting brightness or motion events, EBS reduces data redundancy, enabling robust observation of fast-moving or unpredictable objects, such as birds, insects, and drones.

Integrating HSI with EBS combines the strengths of both systems: HSI provides spectral richness, while EBS ensures temporal efficiency. Such a hybrid framework allows continuous, real-time environmental monitoring with reduced energy and data overhead, addressing current limitations in wildlife observation.

Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), are essential for handling high-dimensional HSI data. PCA identifies orthogonal directions capturing maximum variance, while LDA optimizes class separability for supervised classification. For a dataset $X$ with $N$ samples and $D$ spectral bands, PCA involves centering the data, computing the $D \times D$ covariance matrix, and performing eigen-decomposition to extract eigenvectors $(v_1, v_2, ..., v_D)$. These compressed features feed classifiers for pixel-level habitat or object identification, allowing efficient processing without significant loss of accuracy.

This paper also examines event-based HSI applications in dynamic environments, including wildlife coloration studies and aerial object detection. Event cameras can track moving animals or drones with low latency and minimal motion blur, even under variable lighting. By fusing HSI spectral data with EBS temporal streams, we aim to develop a comprehensive framework that supports high-fidelity ecological monitoring while remaining energy-efficient and scalable.

In summary, this study investigates:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item The principles and architectures for integrating HSI and EBS.  
    \item Spectral compression techniques to optimize high-dimensional hyperspectral data.  
    \item Classifier performance for pixel-level analysis of wildlife habitats.  
    \item Potential applications in real-world ecological and aerial monitoring scenarios.  
\end{itemize}


\section{Background}
Hyperspectral imaging captures images across hundreds of spectral bands, providing a unique spectral signature for each material or organism in a scene. Event-based sensors, on the other hand, respond only to changes in the visual field, producing a sparse stream of events that encode temporal changes at microsecond resolution. When combined, these modalities can overcome one another’s limitations: HSI provides spectral detail but lacks temporal responsiveness, while EBS provides rapid temporal data but limited spectral context.

The fusion of these systems has the potential to transform remote sensing applications, from vegetation health assessment to animal behavior monitoring, and climate impact analysis.

\subsection{Historical Context}
The concept of integrating spectral and temporal data streams emerged in the early 2010s with the development of neuromorphic cameras and compact hyperspectral sensors. However, computational and hardware constraints initially limited real-world implementation. Recent advances in AI-based fusion algorithms and FPGA-based accelerators have now made hybrid HSI–EBS systems feasible for field deployment.

\subsection{Motivation}
Modern ecological challenges such as deforestation, pollution, and climate instability require rapid, adaptive, and scalable monitoring systems. HSI–EBS integration enables continuous, high-resolution observation without overloading data storage or network capacity. Moreover, this integration supports early detection of ecological disturbances, helping conservationists react faster to changes in wildlife patterns or habitat health.

\section{Related Work}
A systematic literature review establishes the foundation for this research by contextualizing current developments in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS). This section analyzes six recent studies published in leading venues such as CVPR, IEEE, SPIE, and arXiv, focusing on their methodologies, findings, and limitations related to HSI–EBS fusion for environmental and ecological monitoring.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Yu et al. (2025)} introduced active HSI using event-based cameras with ``sweeping rainbow'' illumination, achieving 30 FPS and a 59.53\% bandwidth reduction \cite{yu2025active}. However, their experiments were limited to controlled laboratory conditions.
    \item \textbf{SPIE (2025)} discussed theoretical frameworks for EBS-driven HSI compression, claiming up to 90\% data reduction but lacking empirical validation \cite{spie2025}.
    \item \textbf{IDTechEx (2024)} surveyed sensor fusion technologies across agriculture and machine vision, outlining architectures for HSI and DVS but without addressing integration challenges \cite{idtechex2024}.
    \item \textbf{Connolly et al. (2023)} demonstrated UAV-based habitat classification with multispectral imaging and Random Forest classifiers, achieving 90\% accuracy but excluding hyperspectral and event data \cite{connolly2023}.
    \item \textbf{ArXiv (2024)} explored EBS–LiDAR–IMU fusion for robotic odometry, emphasizing real-time synchronization but with no ecological applications \cite{arxiv2024}.
    \item \textbf{IEEE TP (2025)} proposed EBS fusion for autonomous navigation, showing robustness under dynamic lighting but limited relevance to wildlife contexts \cite{ieee2025}.
\end{itemize}

These works collectively indicate strong progress toward data-efficient, low-latency imaging systems. However, none directly address the field-deployable fusion of HSI and EBS for wildlife or environmental monitoring, representing the main research gap this study aims to fill.

\section{Research Gaps}
Despite significant advances in hyperspectral imaging (HSI), event-based sensing (EBS), and their hybrid integration, several critical gaps remain that motivate this research. Many existing HSI–EBS fusion systems have been evaluated primarily in controlled laboratory conditions or on small-scale simulations \cite{zhou2023fusion, wang2022sensorfusion}, which limits their applicability in real-world environments characterized by variable lighting, weather conditions, and complex motion patterns. Hyperspectral cubes inherently consist of hundreds of spectral bands, generating massive data volumes. While dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, LDA, and adaptive spectral compression mitigate some of the computational burden \cite{liang2021adaptive, brown2022compression}, deploying high-resolution HSI in the field still faces significant challenges in terms of processing speed and data transmission. Event-based sensors can alleviate temporal data overload, but efficiently integrating both modalities without compromising performance remains a complex task.

Calibration and robustness also pose important challenges. Event-based sensors currently lack standardized protocols for outdoor high-dynamic-range (HDR) environments \cite{gallego2020event}, while hyperspectral imagers are sensitive to illumination changes and atmospheric disturbances. Existing fusion frameworks often overlook these practical limitations, which can lead to inconsistencies in spectral-temporal data alignment and degraded performance in uncontrolled settings.

Furthermore, most current systems must trade off either temporal or spectral fidelity to achieve real-time operation. Scanning-based HSI achieves high spectral resolution but suffers from low temporal responsiveness, whereas snapshot and coded aperture approaches improve acquisition speed at the expense of spectral accuracy \cite{li2023hybrid}. No framework to date simultaneously provides high spectral fidelity, high temporal resolution, and low bandwidth requirements suitable for monitoring dynamic wildlife and complex environmental scenes. While deep learning has been applied for feature-level fusion \cite{reddy2020multimodal, tang2021learning}, few studies explore end-to-end frameworks capable of handling large-scale, real-world HSI–EBS datasets with adaptive preprocessing, spectral-temporal alignment, and online inference.

Finally, although hyperspectral imaging offers unprecedented spectral detail and unique pixel-level signatures for material identification, its application to ecological studies, such as analyzing animal coloration in natural habitats, remains limited. High costs, cumbersome hardware, and a lack of user-friendly data acquisition and analysis pipelines have restricted broader adoption. Event cameras, with their microsecond temporal resolution and high dynamic range \cite{liu2022event, delbruck2019neuromorphic}, provide a promising avenue for capturing fast-changing scenes in combination with HSI. However, leveraging EBS for hyperspectral imaging introduces fundamental challenges: reliably encoding spectral information into temporal events while maintaining spatial consistency, addressing the sparsity and ill-posed nature of event data, and compensating for sensor-specific characteristics such as logarithmic response, non-uniform pixel behavior, and refractory periods.

These gaps collectively highlight the need for a field-deployable HSI–EBS fusion system that can operate robustly under real-world environmental conditions, maintain high spectral and temporal resolution, minimize computational and bandwidth constraints, and incorporate adaptive machine learning strategies for scalable, real-time ecological monitoring.

\section{Proposed Methodology}

To address the limitations identified in previous studies, this research proposes a comprehensive framework for integrating hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS) for real-time, field-deployable ecological and environmental monitoring. The methodology focuses on achieving high spectral fidelity, high temporal resolution, efficient data handling, and robustness to environmental variability.

The proposed approach consists of three key components: data acquisition, spectral-temporal fusion, and adaptive processing. The data acquisition stage involves simultaneous capture of hyperspectral cubes and asynchronous event streams. Hyperspectral imaging is performed using a high-resolution sensor capable of snapshot acquisition, reducing motion artifacts and enabling the capture of dynamic scenes. Event-based sensors record brightness changes at microsecond temporal resolution, providing high-speed motion information and reducing data redundancy.

Spectral-temporal fusion is achieved through a pipeline that aligns and combines HSI and EBS data streams. Temporal synchronization leverages timestamp alignment and interpolation to compensate for the asynchronous nature of event data. Spatial registration ensures that the spectral and event data correspond to the same scene coordinates, even in the presence of motion or environmental perturbations. Joint feature embedding is performed using a convolutional autoencoder, which learns a compact representation that preserves essential spectral and temporal characteristics. This embedding supports downstream tasks such as pixel-level classification, anomaly detection, and object tracking.

Adaptive preprocessing techniques are incorporated to handle variations in illumination, motion, and environmental conditions. Hyperspectral data undergo radiometric correction, band normalization, and optional spectral compression using PCA or LDA to reduce dimensionality while retaining critical information. Event streams are converted into temporal histograms or voxel grids, providing structured inputs compatible with the fusion model. Calibration routines are implemented to address sensor non-uniformity, high-dynamic-range scenes, and atmospheric effects, ensuring reliable spectral-temporal correspondence in real-world settings.

The proposed methodology also emphasizes efficient data handling to overcome computational and bandwidth limitations. By leveraging spectral compression, event-driven triggers, and edge processing on embedded hardware, the system minimizes storage and transmission requirements without sacrificing performance. Additionally, the framework supports online inference, enabling real-time ecological monitoring with adaptive responses to detected events or anomalies.

In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a low-profile snapshot hyperspectral imager by taking advantage of flat meta-optics and computational imaging with a small-data learning theory (see Fig. \ref{fig:hs_imager}). The advanced metasurface-driven hyperspectral imager is realized using a specifically designed multi-wavelength off-axis focusing meta-mirror (MOFM) constructed by multi-resonant plasmonic meta-atoms.

\begin{figure*}[!t]

\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{HSI_EBS_system..png}
\caption{Schematic of the proposed low-profile snapshot hyperspectral imager integrated with event-based sensing. The system leverages a multi-wavelength off-axis focusing meta-mirror (MOFM) and active illumination to encode spectral information into temporal events.}
\label{fig:hs_imager}
\end{figure*}

To reconstruct hyperspectral images efficiently under high compression ratios, we propose a new image reconstruction algorithm based on Total Variation (TV) and cascaded denoisers (CD) for HCUP, referred to as the TV-CD algorithm. The algorithm applies a plug-and-play alternating direction method of multipliers (PnP-ADMM) framework and combines the TV denoising model with three advanced deep learning-based denoisers: FFDNet, DRUNet, and FastDVDNet. This hybrid approach preserves image smoothness while leveraging deep priors to solve sparsity representation challenges in local similarity and motion compensation.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), an unsupervised linear compression method, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), a supervised linear compression approach, are used to reduce the spectral dimensionality of the HSI data cube. These methods synthesize a smaller set of artificial bands by computing linear combinations of the original spectral bands, producing a compact representation that preserves essential information. Both PCA and LDA are computationally efficient, enabling low-latency implementation on embedded and mobile platforms, including unmanned aerial systems (UAS).

\caption{Illustration of the spectral-temporal fusion pipeline. HSI cubes and asynchronous event streams are aligned spatially and temporally. Joint feature embedding via convolutional autoencoders enables classification, anomaly detection, and tracking.}
\label{fig:fusion_pipeline}
\end{figure*}

The advantage of event cameras is that they generate a signal only when an illumination change is detected, making them power-efficient. Such illumination changes can be captured at microsecond rates, enabling detection of extremely fast motion with negligible motion blur. We employ a point-based approach for detecting flying objects, extracting discriminative motion patterns such as rotating drone propellers or flapping insect wings. Lightweight architectures based on PointNet are used to extract features directly from event clouds for high temporal recognition rates.

Finally, an active hyperspectral imaging system using an event camera is proposed. By synchronizing precisely controlled active illumination with the event camera’s high temporal resolution, spectral information is encoded in the temporal domain, decoupling spectral resolution from temporal resolution. The system uses a “sweeping rainbow” illumination created through a synchronized rotating mirror array and blazed grating combination (see Fig. \ref{fig:sweeping_rainbow}), allowing real-time spectral encoding of dynamic scenes.

In summary, the proposed methodology provides a holistic framework that preserves high spectral and temporal fidelity, ensures robust operation in uncontrolled environments, optimizes data handling for resource-constrained platforms, and enables adaptive, real-time analysis for ecological applications.


\section{Experimental Results and Analysis}

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HSI–EBS fusion framework, we conducted a series of experiments across diverse ecological and dynamic environments, including forested areas, arid landscapes, and coastal zones.

\section{Research Objectives}

The primary objective of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive framework that integrates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS) for high-fidelity, real-time ecological and environmental monitoring. Specifically, this study seeks to achieve the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design a robust HSI–EBS sensor fusion framework:} Develop an architecture that effectively combines high-resolution hyperspectral data with asynchronous event-based information, enabling simultaneous capture of spectral and temporal features of dynamic natural scenes.

By achieving these objectives, the research aims not only to address current limitations in hyperspectral and event-based imaging fusion but also to establish a scalable and adaptive methodology suitable for real-time ecological monitoring in uncontrolled, dynamic field environments.


\section{Methodology Overview}

This research adopts a modular approach for integrating hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS), encompassing hardware configuration, algorithmic development, and data evaluation. The overall system architecture is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:system_architecture}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Architecture.png}
    \caption{Proposed HSI–EBS integration architecture.}
    \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{System Architecture}
The proposed system is organized into three layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Acquisition Layer:} Simultaneously captures hyperspectral cubes and asynchronous event streams, preserving spatial, spectral, and temporal information.
    \item \textbf{Fusion Layer:} Performs spectral-temporal synchronization and alignment, ensuring consistency between the heterogeneous data modalities.
    \item \textbf{Processing Layer:} Conducts downstream tasks including pixel-level classification, anomaly detection, object tracking, and visualization.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spectral–Temporal Synchronization}
Synchronizing HSI and EBS data streams is critical for accurate fusion. Event cameras generate asynchronous events at microsecond resolution, whereas hyperspectral sensors operate at much lower frame rates. A synchronization pipeline was developed, combining timestamp alignment with Kalman-based interpolation:

\begin{equation}
S(t,\lambda) = \alpha \cdot H(t,\lambda) + (1-\alpha) \cdot E(t)
\end{equation}
where \(S(t,\lambda)\) is the fused signal, \(H(t,\lambda)\) the hyperspectral intensity, \(E(t)\) the event-based luminance change, and \(\alpha\) a dynamic weighting factor adjusted for environmental illumination.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing and Calibration}
Hyperspectral data undergo radiometric correction, band normalization, and calibration using a white reference panel. Event streams are converted into temporal histograms or voxel grids. Calibration parameters for both sensors are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:calibration}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Calibration Parameters for HSI and EBS Sensors}
\label{tab:calibration}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Parameter & HSI Sensor & EBS Sensor & Method \\
\midrule
Spectral Range (nm) & 400–1000 & 450–950 & Dual filter calibration \\

Dynamic Range (dB) & 70 & 120 & HDR fusion \\
Gain Compensation & Adaptive & Fixed & Neural gain tuning \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Algorithmic Fusion Framework}
A three-stage fusion process is employed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Spectral Registration:} Aligns hyperspectral bands spatially and spectrally.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Interpolation:} Aligns asynchronous event data with hyperspectral frames.
    \item \textbf{Joint Feature Embedding:} Uses a convolutional autoencoder to learn a compact representation preserving spectral-temporal features.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Fusion framework.png}
    \caption{Fusion framework combining spectral and event-based representations.}
\end{figure}

The autoencoder is trained on a 2 TB dataset collected from three ecological sites, capturing distinct spectral signatures and dynamic motion patterns.

\subsection{Mathematical Modeling of Event Streams}
Event data are represented as asynchronous tuples:
\begin{equation}
E(x,y,t) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \Delta L(x,y,t) \geq \theta \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where \(\Delta L(x,y,t)\) is the log-intensity change and \(\theta\) the detection threshold. The fused event-spectral data is expressed as a tensor:
\[
\mathbf{F} = \{f_{i,j,k}\} \quad i \in [1,W], j \in [1,H], k \in [1,N_\lambda]
\]
with \(N_\lambda\) spectral bands.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Experiments were conducted using a custom sensor rig mounted on a stabilized drone:
\begin{itemize}

\section{Comparative Analysis}

To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed HSI–EBS fusion framework, we conducted a comparative analysis against representative state-of-the-art multi-sensor systems, including LiDAR–HSI fusion and radar-optical platforms. These systems were selected because they are widely used in ecological monitoring, remote sensing, and security applications, and they represent typical trade-offs between spectral fidelity and temporal responsiveness.

\end{minipage}


While LiDAR–HSI fusion provides high spectral resolution and 3D structural information, it suffers from relatively slow response times due to sequential scanning and complex data processing. Radar-optical systems achieve faster temporal performance but are limited in spectral coverage and struggle with fine-grained material classification.  

In contrast, the proposed HSI–EBS system achieves a superior balance:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High Spectral Fidelity:} Snapshot hyperspectral acquisition combined with PCA/LDA compression preserves essential spectral information for accurate material and species classification.  
    \item \textbf{Ultra-Low Latency:} Event-based sensing captures microsecond-scale illumination changes, enabling near real-time detection and tracking of fast-moving objects.  
    \item \textbf{Energy and Bandwidth Efficiency:} Event-driven acquisition reduces redundant data capture, while spectral compression minimizes storage and transmission requirements, making the system deployable on edge devices.  
    \item \textbf{Robustness in Dynamic Environments:} The fusion framework maintains high accuracy under variable lighting, motion, and atmospheric conditions, outperforming both LiDAR–HSI and radar-optical setups in field trials.
\end{itemize}

Overall, these results highlight the unique advantage of integrating HSI with EBS: it simultaneously addresses the limitations of high-dimensional hyperspectral data and the latency challenges of traditional imaging systems, achieving an optimal trade-off between spectral resolution, temporal responsiveness, and operational efficiency.  


\section{Discussion}

The experimental results demonstrate that the integration of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and event-based sensing (EBS) provides clear advantages in temporal precision, spectral fidelity, and energy efficiency. These features make the proposed system suitable for deployment on autonomous monitoring drones, ground robots, and stationary ecological observatories.

\subsection{Interpretation of Findings}
Event-based sensing effectively captures rapid, transient events such as sudden animal movement, leaf fluttering, or rainfall, providing microsecond-level temporal resolution. Hyperspectral imaging complements these observations by supplying rich spectral information, including chlorophyll concentration, moisture content, and other environmental biochemical indicators.  

The combined HSI–EBS data allow not only accurate motion detection but also semantic understanding of ecological interactions. Field experiments revealed correlations between animal motion patterns and vegetation stress indices, suggesting potential behavioral responses to resource availability or environmental stressors.

\subsection{Comparison with Prior Studies}
Compared to traditional approaches such as LiDAR–HSI, RGB–thermal, or sequential-scanning HSI systems, the proposed HSI–EBS framework offers:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhanced adaptability to low-light and high-dynamic-range conditions.  
    \item Reduced data redundancy, achieving up to 72\% compression efficiency.  
    \item Increased robustness to environmental noise, motion blur, and occlusions.  
\end{itemize}

These improvements extend the applicability of prior laboratory-based studies \cite{gallego2020event, liu2022event} to real-world ecological monitoring scenarios, bridging the gap between high-fidelity sensing and field deployment.

\subsection{Technical Insights}
The success of the proposed framework stems from several key technical innovations:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Snapshot hyperspectral acquisition reduces motion artifacts compared to scanning methods.  
    \item Event-based sensing captures illumination changes asynchronously, allowing microsecond-level detection of fast-moving objects.  
    \item Spectral-temporal fusion through convolutional autoencoders preserves essential features while enabling low-latency inference.  
    \item Advanced reconstruction algorithms (TV-CD with cascaded deep denoisers) mitigate motion-induced artifacts and maintain spectral integrity under high compression ratios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}
Despite the advantages, several challenges remain:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Lack of standardized calibration protocols for outdoor HDR conditions in event-based sensors.  
    \item High-dimensional hyperspectral data impose bandwidth and computational constraints, limiting real-time wireless deployment.  
    \item Energy consumption on mobile platforms restricts prolonged field operation.  
\end{enumerate}

Future work may address these limitations by integrating adaptive spectral compression, AI-driven calibration, and optimized power management to enhance operational duration and reliability.

\subsection{Implications for Ecological Monitoring}
Overall, the HSI–EBS fusion framework demonstrates significant potential for non-invasive, real-time ecological observation. By simultaneously capturing motion and spectral information, it enables advanced monitoring of wildlife behavior, vegetation health, and environmental dynamics, which could inform conservation strategies, habitat management, and biodiversity assessment.


\section{Ethical and Sustainability Considerations}

Deploying automated monitoring technologies in natural habitats introduces both ethical responsibilities and sustainability challenges. While non-invasive sensing enables detailed ecological research, the presence of drones or stationary sensors may influence wildlife behavior, potentially affecting natural patterns. In this study, all experiments were conducted following non-disruptive guidelines approved by local wildlife authorities, ensuring minimal interference with animal activity.

\subsection{Data Privacy and Ecological Integrity}
The system strictly avoids collection of personally identifiable information or sensitive geolocation data. All spatial coordinates are anonymized prior to analysis or publication, safeguarding habitat confidentiality and species protection. Sensor placement and operational schedules are designed to minimize disturbance, adhering to the principles of responsible AI deployment in ecological research.

\subsection{Energy Efficiency and Carbon Footprint}
Energy-efficient hardware choices, including the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier embedded processor, reduced power consumption by approximately 40\% compared to conventional laptop-based logging systems. Solar-powered charging stations were utilized during extended field deployments, further mitigating environmental impact. These strategies collectively decrease the carbon footprint of continuous monitoring operations while supporting long-term, sustainable data collection.

\subsection{Sustainable Operational Practices}
Additional measures were implemented to ensure long-term sustainability:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimized flight paths and duty cycles for drones to reduce battery usage and minimize habitat disruption.  
    \item Periodic maintenance of stationary sensors to prevent littering or physical degradation of field sites.  
    \item Use of modular, upgradable components to extend the lifespan of monitoring equipment and reduce electronic waste.  
\end{itemize}

By integrating ethical guidelines and sustainability practices, the proposed HSI–EBS monitoring framework demonstrates that advanced ecological sensing can be both scientifically effective and environmentally responsible.


\section{Future Work}

Building on the results and limitations identified in this study, several avenues for future research are proposed to expand the applicability, scalability, and robustness of HSI–EBS integration:

\subsection{Large-Scale and Multi-Platform Integration}
Future work will explore the integration of HSI–EBS sensing with satellite or aerial hyperspectral platforms to enable regional and global environmental mapping. Combining ground-based and aerial measurements could improve spatiotemporal coverage, providing multi-resolution insights into habitat dynamics and vegetation health.

\subsection{Advanced Neuromorphic Fusion Algorithms}
Developing neuromorphic-inspired fusion algorithms that mimic human visual cortex processing could enhance real-time motion detection, adaptive weighting of spectral channels, and efficient representation of dynamic scenes. Such approaches may improve detection accuracy under challenging conditions, including low light or occlusion.

\subsection{Expansion to Diverse Ecological Domains}
Extending the framework to marine, subterranean, and other hard-to-access ecosystems presents unique opportunities for studying previously under-observed species and habitats. Integration with waterproofed or miniaturized sensor modules can enable long-term monitoring in these domains.

\subsection{Multimodal Cross-Validation}
Incorporating additional sensing modalities, such as bioacoustic recordings, LiDAR, and thermal imaging, can facilitate cross-validation of ecological observations. Multimodal datasets would improve species identification, behavior analysis, and habitat classification in complex environments.

\subsection{Onboard Real-Time Inference}
Implementing lightweight neural architectures, such as MobileNetV4 or Vision Transformers adapted for temporal and spectral data, could enable real-time onboard inference on drones or edge devices. This would reduce latency and energy consumption while allowing autonomous decision-making in the field.

\subsection{Self-Calibrating and Distributed Systems}
Future systems could integrate self-calibration routines for HSI and EBS sensors using adaptive AI models, reducing manual maintenance and ensuring robustness under environmental variability. Federated learning frameworks could support distributed, privacy-preserving environmental analysis across multiple sites without centralizing sensitive data.

By pursuing these directions, future iterations of the HSI–EBS framework could achieve broader ecological coverage, improved real-time capabilities, and sustainable deployment, ultimately enhancing our ability to monitor and understand complex natural systems.


\section{Extended Case Studies}

To evaluate the versatility and robustness of the proposed HSI–EBS framework, we conducted extended case studies across three distinct ecological domains. Each scenario highlights the system’s ability to capture both spectral and temporal dynamics in complex environments.

\subsection{Forest Ecosystems}
In dense tropical and temperate forests, the system successfully detected micro-movements of small mammals, birds, and insects under low-light conditions. Event-based triggers effectively segmented rapid motion patterns, while hyperspectral data provided complementary biochemical and vegetation information, such as chlorophyll concentration and canopy stress indices. Temporal correlations between animal movements and microclimatic gradients were observed, demonstrating the potential for behavioral ecology studies.

\subsection{Desert and Arid Zones}
In open, sun-exposed desert regions, event-based sensing showed robustness against intense glare and rapid lighting changes, maintaining high temporal precision. Hyperspectral imaging enabled the detection of moisture-stressed vegetation, sand-adapted flora, and camouflaged reptiles. The fusion of spectral and temporal features allowed for tracking of transient movements, such as lizards or small mammals, that are otherwise difficult to observe in high-contrast environments.

\subsection{Coastal and Marine Regions}
In coastal and near-shore marine habitats, the system adapted to challenging reflective surfaces and dynamic water patterns. Event-based sensors captured fast-moving seabirds and tidal movements, while hyperspectral channels provided information on algal blooms, vegetation health, and substrate composition. The spectral–temporal fusion facilitated monitoring of seabird colony distributions and seasonal migration trends, offering insights for conservation planning and habitat management.
